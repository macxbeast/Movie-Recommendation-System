This repository contains the implementation of a content-based movie recommendation system. The system suggests movies to users based on similarities in movie content such as descriptions, genres, and metadata.

## Overview
The movie recommendation system is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions to users without relying on user preferences. Instead, it analyzes the content similarity between movies to make recommendations.

* Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive data preprocessing and analysis were performed using Pandas and NumPy to efficiently manage and optimize datasets.

- Content-Based Recommendation: Movies are recommended based on their similarity in content attributes such as descriptions, genres, cast, crew, etc.

+ Vectorization and Similarity Measurement: Utilized Bag of Words vectorization and cosine similarity techniques to quantify and measure the similarity between movie contents.
